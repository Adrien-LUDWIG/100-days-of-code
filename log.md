## Day 1: October 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I started Exercism C++ dust off my knowledge after 9 months without touching it.
I'm taking things slow to grab every piece of information provided in the concepts.

**Thoughts:**

- It's nice to use C++ after 9 months of Python.
- I learned that it's possible to use an apostrophe `'` to write integer
  literals with more readability, example: `42123 == 42'123` is true.
