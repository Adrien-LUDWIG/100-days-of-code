## Day 1: October 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I started Exercism C++ dust off my knowledge after 9 months without touching it.
I'm taking things slow to grab every piece of information provided in the
concepts.

On a completely different note, I attended the [Digital
Collage](https://digitalcollage.org/) (or Fresque du Num√©rique, in french) this
morning. It's a workshop to understand, as a team and in a fun way, the impact
of digital technologies on the environment. I did not touch a computer but it's
indirectly linked since I learned facts, figures and orders of magnitude about
IT environmental impact which will, in turn, help me to design more responsible projects.

**Thoughts:**

- It's nice to use C++ after 9 months of Python.
- I learned that it's possible to use an apostrophe `'` to write integer
  literals with more readability, example: `42123 == 42'123` is true.
