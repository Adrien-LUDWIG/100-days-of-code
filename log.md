# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Day 0: October 11, 2023

Like any self-respecting developer, I count from 0. üòÑ
But today I'm only setting up this repository, where I'll keep logs throughout
the challenge, by removing unneeded content from the template repository and
making the rules my own.

Why did I remove some rules?

First, I don't use Tweeter. To still make myself accountable I'll report to my
family and friends. I'll also try posting updates in certain IT communities.

Then, I removed the rule about counting only work on projects and not on
exercises, tutorials and other similar ressources. I feel like this rule applies
more to front-end (/ web / app) development where creating a portfolio is
essential. As I want to work on computer science and back-end development but
also take part to open source as part of this challenge, I'm not sure it makes
as much sense. I'll try to produce as much concret work as possible but I don't
want to restrict myself too much.

Here is a list of things I want to work on:

- Dust off C++ ([Exercism](https://exercism.org/) to start with)
- Participate in [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.com/) 2023 and [Global
  Hack Week - Open Source](https://ghw.mlh.io/events/open-source)
- [Exercism #12in23 challenge](https://exercism.org/challenges/12in23): discover Ruby as part of Object-Oriented October.
- Follow the [back end roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/backend) of
  [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh)
- Discover Go, using:
  - the [Go roadmap](https://roadmap.sh/golang)
  - the [Go track on Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/go)
  - [gophercises](https://gophercises.com/) projects
- Computer Science, to expand on what I already learned during my master. I'd
  like to take a closer look at [Teach Yourself Computer
  Science](https://teachyourselfcs.com/), starting with compilers.
- Personal projects:
  - ioi2git, scrape my France IOI solutions to push them on GitHub
  - Create a tool to export personal MoviesFad data
  - [My Tiny Lisp Interpreter](https://github.com/Adrien-LUDWIG/Tiny-Lisp-Interpreter)
  - ...
- Learn more about Docker (and Kubernetes). Follow their roadmaps.
- Continue freeCodeCamp, especially the back end part.
- ...

I probably won't be able to work on everything here...but I'll continue in my
next 100 days! üòÅ

## Day 1: October 12, 2023

**Today's Progress**:

I started Exercism C++ dust off my knowledge after 9 months without touching it.
I'm taking things slow to grab every piece of information provided in the
concepts.

On a completely different note, I attended the [Digital
Collage](https://digitalcollage.org/) (or Fresque du Num√©rique, in french) this
morning. It's a workshop to understand, as a team and in a fun way, the impact
of digital technologies on the environment. I did not touch a computer but it's
indirectly linked since I learned facts, figures and orders of magnitude about
IT environmental impact which will, in turn, help me to design more responsible projects.

**Thoughts:**

- It's nice to use C++ after 9 months of Python.
- I learned that it's possible to use an apostrophe `'` to write integer
  literals with more readability, example: `42123 == 42'123` is true.

## Day 2 & 3: October 13 & 14, 2023

These two days were peculiar days. I attended Hackvens 2023, an event organized
by the french cybersecurity company Advens. On the program: conferences during
the day and CTF during the night!

## Day 10: October 21, 2023

I did LeetCode daily challenge, [1425. Constrained Subsequence
Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/constrained-subsequence-sum/) (rated hard), in
Python. I needed hints
but it was very interesting to explore 2 points in detail:

- Dynamic Programming
- Sliding window max using collections.deque
